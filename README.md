# Michael Rambeau's personal web site

This web site describes my experience as an IT engineer working in Japan.

The web site is powered by [docpad](http://docpad.org), a tool built on top of node.js that can be used to generate static web sites.

I took advantage of the flexibility of docpad to create pages using different templating languages:
* [CoffeeKup](http://coffeekup.org/) (CoffeeCup used as a templating language)
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

I used [Stylus](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus) CSS preprocessor and [Purecss](http://purecss.io) CSS components to make the web site mobile-friendly.
