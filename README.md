# Michael's Rambeau web site

A web site to describe my experience and show my skills.

My web site has been built using Docpad, a tool built on top of nodejs that can be used to generate static web sites.
The web site is mobile-friendly thank to purecss.io components.

I use CoffeKup as templating language to create all pages, including the blog entries.

Technologies:
- docpad
- Stylus
- CoffeeScript / CoffeeKup
