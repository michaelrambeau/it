# Michael's Rambeau web site

A static web site built with docpad, a very flexible site generator using node.js.
The web site is mobile-friendly thank to bootstrap UI components.
I used CoffeeKup as templating language for the pages.

Technologies:
- docpad
- Bootstrap
- LESS
- CoffeeScript / CoffeeKup
