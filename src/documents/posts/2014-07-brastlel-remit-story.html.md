In 2013, I was working as a web developer for a Japanese company.
I was in charge of [Brastel Remit web site](http://brastelremit.jp) (a service of money transfer from Japan to overseas), but I was not fully satisfied by the web site, for 3 reasons:

* The site was not mobile-friendly although statistics show that half of visitors use mobile devices.
* The front home page was nice but did not convey any message.
* The subscription process, used to register new customers, was awkward.

Check how the previous version was [here](http://michaelrambeau.com/it/projects/brastelremit-v1/).

I tried to make suggestions several times but no decision was taken.
I was working from Osaka but the rest of the team was in Tokyo main office.
So it was a kind of "remote work".
Design and content were decided in Tokyo and I had to implement them from Osaka.  

I was not really involved in the decisions.
So how to make people listen to me, how to promote the changes that were needed to improve the web site ?



##The proposal

In 2013 July, I decided to make things happen.
First I shared a document about the improvement I wanted to implement.
The document was split into 3 parts:

* A marketing-oriented home page
* A mobile friendly-site
* A smoother registration process

I hesitated about the title of the document.
First it was called "Crucial points to be improved" because I really wanted people to realize the weak points of the current site.
My colleague found the perfect word: "proposal".
Suddenly, the document had an other impact.

Then I implemented an [online prototype](http://michaelrambeau.com/it/projects/brastelremit/) : a static web site, with only 5 functional pages, in order to show people what could be done.
I chose to implement a solution using what is called "Responsive Web Design": the same web site behaves differently depending on the device screen.
I asked people to check the prototype from their mobiles.
With the prototype, people can clearly see what I proposed.

I sent an email on August the 7th, the conlusion was:

> 今こそ行動の時だ。でないとチャンスを逃がすことになる

Meaning that "it is time to act!" (it was the only part of the mail in Japanese).
I had been waiting anxiously for the reactions all day long...

##The reactions
One of the fist reactions came from a manager of the IT Department.
>I was waiting for some move like this coming from web devs.
Good document, no objection points so far.
<small>S.K.</small>

A discussion started about what was "Responsive design".

Later, I got a message from one of the persons of charge of the Remittance business.

> The Remittance team here considers this is a good proposal.
We agree fully with the concept of having one site that is responsive to all devices.
We understand that for the transition there might probably be some compromises need to be made, 
but we expect it will be done with very minimum layout changes and no functional changes.
<small>H.P.</small>

One day later, I got the last reaction, which was the most awaited, from the advertisement section leader (who was my manager!)

> The concept of the site is very good and it is very friendly for  those who access from various type of devices.
Only that we need to discuss  with design team more on how to work out with the layout. (Limitations on the layout etc)
Anyway, it was a good surprise from your side!!!
 <small>H.K.</small>


Despite my fears, all reactions were positive.

A meeting with Design team was scheduled the next week.
For the first time, I was included in the creation process.



##The implementation

I thought that even in a Japanese company, it is possible to make things change.
But I was wrong because actually nothing really moved.
The renewal of the web site I requested was not part of the marketing priorities.

So in 2014, 4 months after the proposal I sent, I decided to contact the managers to make them include the web site renewal into their dicussion.

In April, I was told that an other project (to allow users without email to subscribe by SMS) became the new priority.
Because of that new project, I was asked to include new features in the web site.

I told them I wll do that but I will do it using the new "responsive layout", meaning that the 2 projects will be released int he same time.

Basically I took advantage of an other project to "push" my ideas.

I convinced the Brastel Remit manager that I could deliver the web site renewal without delaying the other project.

I was in a rush to finish all pages (around 50 page!) but I did it.



##Conclusion, what I learned

The brand new web site was released on 2014 July, exactly 11 months after the first proposal I sent.
How happy I was ot see "my ideas" on line !

The "Brastel Remit General Executive Manager" manager was happy too:

> Michaelさんの情熱(Passion)はとてもうれしく思います。実現してくれてありがとうございました。

I learned some things about working for a Japanese company:

* Don't expect people to be proactive, they are not!
* To be listened you have to target the right people, people who have power.
* Make sure that your ideas transform into acts and schedules.
