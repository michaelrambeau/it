##The context
I have been working as a web developer for 2 years for a Japanese company, from the small office of the Osaka branch.
I was not fully satisfied by the site I was in charge of (a service of money transfer from Japan to overseas)

* The site was not mobile-friendly although statistics show that half of visitors use mobile devices.
* The front home page was nice but did not convey any message.
* The subscription process, used to register new customers, was awkward.

I tried to make suggestions several times but no decision was taken.
I was working from Osaka but the rest of the team was in Tokyo main office.
So it was a kind of "remote work".
Design and content were decided in Tokyo and I had to implement them from Osaka.  

I was not really involved in the decisions.
So how to make people listen to me, how to promote the changes that are needed to improve the web site  ?



##The proposal

In 2013 July, I decided it was time to act and make things happen.
First I created a Google document with 3 parts:

* A marketing-oriented home page
* A mobile friendly-site
* A smoother registration process

I hesitated about the title of the document.
First it was called "Crucial points to be improved" because I really wanted people to realize the weak points of the current site.
My colleague found the perfect word: "proposal".
Suddenly, the document had an other impact.

Then I implemented  a "prototype" : a static web site, with only 5 functional pages, in order to show people what could be done.
I chose to implement a "Responsive-design" solution: the same web site behaves differently depending on the device screen.
I uploaded on a public web site, asking people to check the result from their mobiles.
With the prototype, people can clearly see what I proposed.
It is easy to criticize, but if you have a proposition , things become different.

I sent an email on August the 7th, anxiously waiting for the reactions all day long.
Luckily, many people can read and write English in my company.
So yhe conclusion of the email was the only part in Japanese:

> 今こそ行動の時だ。でないとチャンスを逃がすことになる

##The reactions
One of the fist reactions came from a manager of the IT Department.
>I was waiting for some move like this coming from web devs.
Good document, no objection points so far.

A discussion started about what was "Responsive design".

Later, I got a message from one of the persons of charge of the Remittance business.

> The Remittance team here considers this is a good proposal.
We agree fully with the concept of having one site that is responsive to all devices.
We understand that for the transition there might probably be some compromises need to be made, 
but we expect it will be done with very minimum layout changes and no functional changes.

One day later, I got the last reaction, which was the most awaited, from the advertisement section leader (my manager!)

> The concept of the site is very good and it is very friendly for  those who access from various type of devices.
Only that we need to discuss  with design team more on how to work out with the layout. (Limitations on the layout etc)
Anyway, it was a good surprise from your side!!!

##Conclusion

Despite my fears, all reactions were positive.

A meeting with Design team was scheduled the next week.
For the first time, I was included in the creation process.

Even in a Japanese company, it is possible to make things change.
To be continued...
