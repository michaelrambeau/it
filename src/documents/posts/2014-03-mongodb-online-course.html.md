[MongoDB](http://www.mongoDB.org) is an open source document-oriented database.

During 7 weeks, I did an online course provided by [MongoDB university](https://university.mongodb.com) called
"M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers".

Here is the course summary, week by week:

1. INTRODUCTION: installing nodejs and mongoDB, using mongoDB shell
2. CRUD: running a web application with mongo nodejs driver
3. SCHEMA DESIGN: relations between data, whether to embed or not
4. PERFORMANCE: how to run fast requests using indexes
5. AGGREGATION FRAMEWORK: how to perform advanced queries
6. APPLICATION ENGINEERING: scaling a "real world" application using replication and sharding
7. [MONGOOSE](http://mongoosejs.com): an "elegant mongoDB object modeling"

Every week, a new unit of about 20 lessons is released. Each lesson is a short Youtube video (less than 5 minutes), followed by a quizz that does not count toward the grade.

The course requires 5 hours a week according to the web site but actually it took me far much time to do the things the right way (to get my final grade: 95%).

A certification of completion (a nice pdf document with your name) is provided at the end of the course, after the final examin.

##The weekly homeworks

4 or 5 homeworks are assigned at the end of the week.

The weekly assignments will comprise one half of the grade and the final exam the other half of the grade.

There are 3 kinds of tasks:

* Answer a question with a single or multiple choices
* Write a query in an interactive mongo shell window
* Customize a node.js application that has to perform a specific task, running a validation script that provides a secret key at the end.

For each task, 3 submissions are allowed and there is an automatic feedback about your answer (right or wrong), making the task not too difficult but you have to meet the dead-line
(you have to finish the week's homework before the next week starts).

##The final examination

The final exam is made of 10 questions, similar to the homeworks.

The difference is that only one submission is allowed, so you have to be very careful before submitting the answer.

There is no feedback right after the submission of the answer, you have to wait around 1 week to get the final result and your "certificate of completion".

Oddly, the most difficult part was the multiple-choice questions.
Some questions with multiple choices are really difficult and require a lot of concentration.

##Feedback
This online course was a good way to get experience about both node.js and MongoDB.
Hands-on exercises are fun.
The "certificate of completion" gives motivation to finish the course with a good grade.

The final message I got after having completing the course was cool ! (it looks like a video game)

> Congratulations! You have successfully completed, with distinction, M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers. Your score puts you in the top 8% of all students who registered for the course - awesome job.

About MongoDB, the way of querying the database and to deal with JSON documents is very smart compared to a tradionnal database.

Now I really feel like using MongoDB in my next project, running my own server or using cloud services like [mLab](https://mlab.com).
