In March 2016, I did a presentation during an event held in Osaka: "開発ツール チラ見せ♡ナイト", that could be translated by "A peek at development tools".

During this night, developers from several companies made a presentation about their work inside their company.

Spectators can discover secrets about development tools, while eating pizzas and drinking beer provided by the organisers!

I did a presentation about "Modern web development" at FirstServer, my company in Osaka.
I explained why and how we built a single-page application using the latest web technologies:

* Webpack
* React
* Redux
* Testing with Mocha
* and many other things...
