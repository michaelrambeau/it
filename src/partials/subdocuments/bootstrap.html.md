In July 2013, I was looking for components to build a mobile-friendly web site.
By any chance, I checked the "Bootstrap" template that was included in my code editor (Netbeans).
How happy I was when I found that it was exactly what I needed:

+ A web page with a layout that changes dynamically depending on the screen size.
+ A navigation menu that becomes a small menu button button with 3 bars, like in facebook, gmail mobile sites

Bootstrap is simple to use and very complete in the sametime.
Some details are amazing. Just an example: 
The 3-bar menu button (used for the main navigation, for mobile screens) is made with HTML/CSS, without any icon.
The same thing for the small triangle used in drop-down menus!
This "UI framework" does not require any picture file.

In addition, the documentation is good and show all possibilities.
The 2 project authors, from Twitter dev team, did a great job... but what was their motivation ?
